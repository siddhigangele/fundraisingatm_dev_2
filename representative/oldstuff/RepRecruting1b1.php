                    	<li>GreatMoods is the First Complete, Quality, Free Online Fundraising Program in the United States.  Nobody else in America has a Fundraising Program with this level of detail, where every participant has a free Facebook type Fundraising page.</li>
                        <li>The great thing about the GreatMoods program is not only does every school get a Free Fundraising Website, every club or team in the school gets a Free Fundraising Website and every student or member of the club or team gets a Free Personalized Fundraising Website.  The kids can set up their webpage just like a FaceBook page, soliciting their friends family to order online. </li>
                        <li>Online Fundraising is the wave of the Future that is here Today with GreatMoods!!!  Kids would much rather fundraise online, using their Laptop &/or Cell Phone, than going door to door selling cookie dough, gift wrap or candy bars given the choice.  </li>
                        <li>The GreatMoods program was designed with today's consumer and Fundraiser in mind.  The Internet Retail Consumer Business has grown at a rate of over 15% a year for 10+ straight years and will continue to have double digit growth for the foreseeable future.  </li>
