    		<h3>What is The GreatMoods Program?</h3>
			    <div id="column1">
<p>GreatMoods is the first complete, quality, Free Online Fundraising Program in the United States.  Nobody else in America has a Fundraising Program with this level of detail, where every participant has a free Facebook-type Fundraising page.</p>

<p>The great thing about the GreatMoods program is not only does every school get a Free Fundraising Website, every club or team in the school gets a Free Fundraising Website and every student or member of the club or team gets a Free Personalized Fundraising Website.  The kids can set up their web page just like a Facebook page, soliciting their friends and family to order online. </p>

<p>Online Fundraising is the wave of the future that is here today with GreatMoods!!!  Kids would much rather fundraise online, using their laptop and/or cell phone, than going door to door selling cookie dough, gift wrap or candy bars, given the choice.  </p>

<p>The GreatMoods program was designed with today’s consumer and Fundraiser in mind.  The Internet Retail Consumer Business has grown at a rate of over 15% a year for 10+ straight years and will continue to have double digit growth for the foreseeable future.  </p>

<h5>Year-round Revenue</h5>
 <p>The program is designed for 4 major Holiday and Special Occasion Fundraisers per year.</p>

<h5>Easy Setup and Maintenance</h5>
            <p>As a GreatMoods Representative, you have a Website that allows you to create a Website for all your organizations to use as their fundraising selling tool. (We will even set them up for you if you get them to say yes, but it is very easy. <a href "#">Here's how.</a>) </p>

<ul>
<li>You don’t have to drive to account to do presentations</li>
<li>You don’t have to collect funds</li>
<li>You don’t have to deliver or arrange delivery of the product</li>
<li>You don’t have to do all the things that take time and money, we do everything for you</li>
<li>We ship the Gift Baskets straight to the consumer so nothing will enter the organization/school</li>
<li>All order processing is done online using PayPal and all funds are distributed as cash the day after a sale is processed.  Funds are available 24/7, 365 days a year</li>
</ul>
