                <h2>Reasons Your Customer will sign up to the GreatMoods Program:</h2>
                <ul>
                	<li>If given the choice, do you think your kids would rather go door to door selling 50 $1 chocolate bars or 1 gift basket online?</li>
                 <li>What do you think the kids' parents would prefer? Door to door or online sales?</li>
                  <li>What do you think the teacher/coach/minister would think of a fundraising program where they have absolutely no handling of any orders, cash or products?</li>
                   <li>What do you think the teacher/coach/minister and you would think of receiving cash next day, 24/7, 365 days a year on every basket sold?  (I can tell you the first thing you will do every morning is check your PayPal account, once this starts).</li>
                    <li>Do you think a School Church or Organization will ever turn off a free fundraising website that gives them 4 major fundraisers a year, pays cash next day and delivers the product straight to the customer?  PayPal also issues a Visa Debit Card so you can go to any ATM and withdraw your cash daily.</li>
                </ul>
            	<h2>Reasons Your Customer will sign up to the GreatMoods Program:</h2>
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Consumer internet retail sales are growing over 15% a year, have been for a decade and will continue that way for the foreseeable future.</li>
                        <li>Virtually every child and family, regardless of their economic status, has a cell phone and is on the internet daily.</li>
                        <li>A child can sell 1 gift basket in 5 minutes online and earn the same amount of money that it would take him of door to door selling for 3 hour.</li>
                        <li>One reality that is positively happening is that the kids and their parents will definitely choose online fundraising  vs. door to door sales in the near future, when given the chance.</li>
                        <li>Door to door sales are going to quickly become a thing of the past and so are the commissions that go with it.</li>
                    </ul>
          	<h2> Reasons you should $ignup and $tart today</h2>
            <ul>
            	<li>If every account you setup and the commission it generates is yours forever, do you really want to risk having another distributor setting up your account with GreatMoods first?</li>
                <li>There is no processing of orders, no collection of cash, no delivery of product by you, the parents, or the kids because GreatMoods delivers the product straight to the customer.</li>
                <li>There are 3-4 fundraisers per year</li>
                <li>Every sale earns cash, paid next day 24/7, 365 days a year, directly to your PayPal account</li>
                <li>Over a third of the distributors I've talked to say the same 2 statements again and again.  "This is too good to be true" and "This is a no brainer".
Every sale earns cash, paid next day 24/7, 365 days a year, directly to your PayPal account</li>
            </ul>
