    <h3>Who is GreatMoods?</h3>
    <div id="column1">
      <p>GreatMoods is a Company that creates consumer related Programs and Products for all of today’s Fundraising needs.</p>
      <p>Fundraising is about to change forever, from door to door sales of Candy, Cookie Dough and Gift Wrap, to Online Fundraising.</p>
      <p>Today’s cell phone/Facebook generation want convenience and will select any online program, app or product, if they can do it in a matter of minutes from home and benefit just as much.</p>
      <p>The GreatMoods program offers Free Personalized Fundraising Websites for every School, Church or Organization. In addition every individual student or member in those clubs and teams also receives a Free Personalized Fundraising Website.</p>
      <h5>Multiple Fundraising Opportunities Each Year!</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>3 to 4 large revenue generating Fundraisers will happen every year, at every account you set up — forever, with the GreatMoods Program!</li>
        <li>Fall time is great with Thanksgiving/Holiday/Christmas Gift Baskets, then after January 1 it’s even better, with Valentine’s Day, Easter and Mother’s Day Gift Baskets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>GreatMoods Gift Baskets contain national brand chocolate bars, cookies, candy, candles and coffee. IPod downloadable music and lifestyle DVDs will be components of most Gift Baskets. Almost every product line you currently sell is a component in our GreatMoods Gift Baskets, wrapped up nicely with a bow.</p>

      <h5>Order Processing and Delivery is Easy!</h5>
      <p>PayPal is the order processing system that we use at every individual website to process every order and ship every Gift Basket straight to the customer/recipient. PayPal is the most trusted and fraud proof online ordering system for the consumer market today on the Internet. There is never a need for you or your accounts to process an order, collect cash, or deliver a single product.</p>
      <p>The days of arranging delivery/distribution of product at the school or church are done forever for both you at the school or church and all the parents having to deliver all this stuff with their children door-to-door after they pick it up from the school.</p>
      <p>They days of picking up and delivering fundraising products are gone forever with the GreatMoods Program.</p>
      <h5>Cash Next Day!</h5>
      <p>Best of all, you and your accounts will receive cash next day on every Gift Basket sold for 2 or 3 fundraising events a year. Every Gift Basket ordered and processed from an individual’s website, you and your account receive a direct deposit into your PayPal account next day.  PayPal has a Visa Debit card you can use at any ATM to access your commissions 24/7, 365 days a year, as your fundraisers are taking place.</p>
      <p>The funny things is we have found that everyone we have worked with the very first thing they do every morning is check to see home much cash has come in the prior day’s fundraising.</p>
