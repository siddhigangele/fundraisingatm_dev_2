		        <li>Explain the FundraisingATM Fundraising Program and how it will address their needs. </li>
		        <li>When they say Yes, be sure to gather all of their necessary contact information, and ask them which specific groups they are interested in setting up and to gather a list of all their leader and member contacts with name, email, and phone numbers.  Also ask them the best place to gather their photos so you can customize their website with them.<br>Note: you can email them the “Leader & Member Contact Information” spreadsheet to be filled out easily.</li>
		        <li>Bring a hard copy of an example Fundraiser website. Just in case the person you’re presenting to doesn’t have internet access. This will be a series of 5 sheets of paper that you’ll have to print out and staple together. </li>
		        <li>Lastly, always bring the basics. A notebook, pen, business card (or a sheet of paper with your basic information on it). </li>
                </ul>


   		<p>* By the time you’re done with your appointment, you should leave behind the Presentation Packet you put together. That way the client has something to look back at once you’ve left. </p>
                <p>*  It’s up to you whether or not you leave the (The Example Fundraiser Packet) with your client. You can either take it or leave it. If they want it, leave it. If you feel it would be beneficial to leave it behind, leave it. </p>
