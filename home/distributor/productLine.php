      <p>Gift Baskets are designed for most events and for every consumer you can think of, year-round.  Online Shopping/Fundraising is going through the roof with double digit annual growth and is perfect for the cell phone and Facebook generation.  This is a great way to raise funds for your organization and take care of your gift list at the same time.</p>
      <p>Gifts Baskets are a great Fundraising Product and with price points for everyone to be able to ship year-round. You can’t ship cookie dough or $1.00 chocolate bars; door to door sales is dying. Online year-round fundraising is the future with our Free Website Fundraising GreatMoods Program.</p>
      <p>GreatMoods delivers every Gift Basket to the address the customer indicated, so there is no handling of the product by you or your accounts.</p>
      <p>All ordering is done online at the Student/Member’s Free Fundraising Website using PayPal. All Cash is distributed next day, 24/7/365 days a year. Online Fundraising just can’t get any better than with our GreatMoods Gift Basket Program. </p>
