    <h1>Cash Next Day!</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div id="column1">
      <p>Best of all your Fundraising organization receives cash next day on every individual Gift Basket sold and it will be paid directly into your PayPal account. By the way anyone can set up a PayPal account because it is like setting up a savings account at a bank. PayPal also has a Visa Debit card available for you that you can use at any ATM to access your organizationâ€™s funds 24/7, 365 days a year.</p>
      <p>GreatMoods will help set up each Club, Team and Organization with a free PayPal account prior to when the Fundraiser begins.  The goal is to help both your organization and its members maximize their income on an ongoing basis with a very easy Fundraiser.  </p>
