    		<h3>The Greatmoods Program</h3>
			    <div id="column1">
<p>GreatMoods is the first complete, quality, Free Online Fundraising Program in the United States. Nobody else in America has a Fundraising Program with this level of detail, where every participant has a free Personalized Facebook-type of fundraising page.</p>

<p>The kids or members can set up their fundraising website just like a Facebook page in a matter of minutes. Soliciting of their friends, family and neighbors to order Gift Baskets and support their Fundraiser can be done from their website.  The best part about the program is, once the Free Personalized Website is set up there are 3 or 4 major fundraisers each year from this one simple setup.</p>

<p>Online Fundraising is the wave of the future that is here today with GreatMoods!!! Kids would much rather fundraise online, using their laptop and/or cell phone, than going door to door selling cookie dough, gift wrap or candy bars, given the choice.</p>

<p>The GreatMoods program was designed with today’s consumer and fundraiser in mind. The Internet Retail Consumer Business has grown at a rate of over 15% a year for 10+ straight years and will continue to have double-digit growth for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h5>Easy Setup, Easy Selling and Easy Maintenance</h5>
            <p>As a GreatMoods Representative, you have your own free website that allows you to create a website for each of your fundraising organizations. Even before you make your first call to your prospect we will set up their Free Fundraising Website. When calling your prospect for the first time is ‘are you in front of a computer, I would like to show you your Free Fundraising Website?’  Your closing ratio will be between 50-80% when they see it. </p>
            <p>Once they say YES, it’s 3 simple steps to setting up their free fundraising website.  If you’re really smart, find a couple kids that have a cell phone and Facebook page, because they can set it up for you in a quality way in a couple hours or GreatMoods will do it for you.  See the 3-step example right <a href="easysetup.php">Here.</a></p>
