	<hr5> 2) Please download and fill out the <a href="">FundraisingATM Representative Agreement</a> so we know how to set up your FundraisingATM Representative Website. </hr5>
	<br>
  	<p>Note: There are thousands of Rep Agreements out there and the bottom line is none of them are perfect. There are no trick clauses and it is designed to cover both of us. FundraisingATM will always use Independent Representatives, period. If you were to get hit by a truck while stepping off a curb, or you were to retire with no one to carry on, we would reassign your Accounts to another FundraisingATM Representative. It is never our intention to work with a Fundraising Account on a direct basis. As long as you maintain the Fundraising Account's Members, answer their questions, and support them in a professional, friendly way, the Fundraising Account should be yours for years. </p>
   		<hr5> 3) Getting paid Cash Next day requires two simple steps:</hr5>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -    Setup Email Address for your PayPal Account <br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -     Setup your PayPal Account (we can help)</p>

       <hr5>4) Scan & Email or Mail us the 1099 and 2 copies of the signed FundraisingATM Representative Agreement.</hr5>
