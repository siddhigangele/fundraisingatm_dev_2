      		<p>Once you’ve identified at least 10-20 Prospective Fundraising Accounts, you need to Email a replica of the Prospects List Document to Sales@FundraisingATM.com, listing off each of the Prospective Fundraising Accounts (Name & Address) along with a link/URL to each organization’s individual website.  This document provides us with the basic information needed to create the Prospect’s Accounts Banner of their Website at your FundraisingATM Representative Website, for you to use as a sales tool.</p>
      		<p>For example, if you want to pursue a prospect within Henry Sibley High School. You would go to Henry Sibley High School’s website, copy the exact link of the website (aka the URL) and paste it in an email to your FundraisingATM Contact or to Sales@FundraisingATM.com</p>
   		<p> Example of what to send us:</p>
   		</div>
	<div id="column1">
            <h5>School Name and Address   </h5>
            <p> Henry Sibley High School<br>
    	    123 Main St.<br>
            Mendota Heights, Minnesota 54321 </p>
             </div> <!--end column1-->

      <div id="column2">
          <h5>School URL  </h5>
          <p> http://www.sibley.isd197.org/ </p>
    	   <br></br><br>
        </div> <!--end column2-->

   	<div>
   		<p>Again, the URL information you provide will allow our Graphics Team to be able to setup each Prospect’s Fundraising Website with a personalized banner. The Graphics Team will click on your Prospect Accounts URL which will bring them to the specific website you what to setup and they will copy and download the banner then resize it to fit our website and finally upload it to your Prospects Website.  </p>
   		<p>That Prospective Account will be set up for you at your FundraisingATM Representative Website if you have not already created it yourself. We’re here to help you succeed, so setting up your Prospect websites will save you hours of time if you are struggling to do it yourself.
