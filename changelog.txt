  Added multi delete from grids feature.

version 2013-07-09
------------------
  preg_replace on $sql_count missing case insensitive flag

version 2013-07-05
------------------
  Changed insert() so user is redirected to the default view (no pagination or search) after adding a record

version 2013-06-30
------------------
  Added lm class name to forms for easier styling.
  Added @ and other fixes to avoid notice messages when accessing array elements and appending strings.
  Fixed date_in() so that d/m/Y dates should work. found out strtotime does not look at locale info.
  New variables to edit individual form buttons; form_add_button, form_update_button, form_back_button, form_delete_button
  Added delete button to form. Move grid delete javascript out to delete_form().
  Added grid_default_order_by to specify the default sort order, otherwise sort by identity_id is used. Adding a sort fixes weird natural sort behavior.
  Form Back/Cancel button now highlights last viewed record on the grid view.
  Renamed grid_delete_confirm to delete_confirm since delete button has been added to the form view.
  Added success message for when records are deleted.
  Fixed csv export() bug related to erasing existing buffers.
  
version 2013-05-08
-------------------

  Added form_default_value to allow defaults when adding a record, also populates from column default.
  Changed all string functions to multibyte to hopefully work properly in other languages.
  Added magic_quotes warning
  Added "set names charset" to make sure communications are in proper characterset
  Changed redirect(), triple equals used for auto-redirect.

version 2013-04-07
-------------------
  Bug fix, sql_param not passed in grid() record count. grrrr, thought this was already fixed...

version 2013-03-07
-------------------
  form_user_function was implemented wrong, should be populated from user function.
  image_resize() was not resizing.
  query_insert() missing optional called_from parameter.

version 2013-02-27
-------------------
  Added uri_path variable to be more flexible. Weird URI seems to be required in WordPress admins.
  Added upload_file_multiple(). It's not used in lazy_mofo but handy to have around.
  Changed export() to work with large datasets and not run out of memory. Also displays errors when ob_start was not started.
  Added after_insert_action and after_update_action to alter default action after updates and inserts. An entry like 'edit' will redirect the user back to the edit/form screen after updates or inserts.
  Added $form_user_function to allow html injection before </form> in form.
  Changed search back to POST. I think there was some kind of issue with WordPress admin that prompted this.
